# LGF Admin Menu

This resource is in its current state, and while it's compatible with QBox and ESX, it requires my `LGF_Utility` for UI management and framework handling. Vehicle, ped, and object data are stored in `web/components/data`. Pull requests for improvements or new features are welcome.

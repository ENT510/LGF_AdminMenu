# LGF Admin Menu

This resource is in its current state, and while it's compatible with QBox and ESX, it requires my `LGF_Utility` for UI management and framework handling. Vehicle, ped, and object data are stored in `web/components/data`. Pull requests for improvements or new features are welcome.

## Configuration

### Required Dependencies:
- **LGF_Utility**: This is required for managing the UI placement, framework interactions, and other essential functions.

2. **Configure Permissions**:
